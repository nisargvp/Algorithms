	-ve cycles:
	For any i-j shortest path where i = j, the value has to be 0 (taking the empty path from
	i to itself). If you start from i and go towards any other node != i (where i=j), in order
	to come back to i you HAVE to traverse a cycle. If this cycle is NOT a -ve cycle, the cost
	of this cycle-path will be greater than 0, thus rendering the shortest i-i path to still be
	the empty path with cost 0.

	BUT if this cycle was a -ve cycle from i to itself, the new cost will be less than the cost
	of the empty path (i.e less than 0). 

	Thus, if any value on the diagonal of our 3D cache is -ve, the path with this -ve cost MUST
	include a -ve cycle. Thus by checking these diagonal i-i values, we can detect whether our
	graph has -ve cycles or not!
