	TSP vs MST:
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3838747/can-tsp-be-solved-by-finding-minimum-spanning-tree-for-the-graph

	"If you're having trouble seeing the difference, in MST, you need to find a minimum weight 
	tree in a weighted graph, while in TSP you need to find a minimum weight path 
	(or cycle / circuit)."

	The Hamiltonian path problem:
	Given an undirected graph with n vertices, decide whether or not there is a (cycle-free) 
	path with nâˆ’1 edges that visits every vertex exactly once
