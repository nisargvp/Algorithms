	Trees:
	http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vertex-cover-problem-set-2-dynamic-programming-solution-tree/

	.txt files for trees will contain edges from root to leaves, thus root is always processed
	first, acc. to the link above^

	Running time, O(m*2^size):
	Exponential time; every recursive call occurs for a size that is 1 less than that of it's
	parent call. Thus, acc. to the recursion tree there'll be O(2^size) num of recursive calls
	before reaching any base-case and the height of this binary recursion tree will be 'size';
	binary tree because there are two recursive calls! There's O(m) work for every recursive
	call, thus total running time becomes O(m*2^size).

	This algorithm is polynomial time as long as size = O(log(n)), so that time = O(m*n). If
	the vertex cover of a graph has size more than this, this algorithm becomes infeasible.

	Also, much better than the na√Øve brute-force time of O(n^size), which comes from taking
	combinations of 'size' from n aka n-choose-size. This is basically trying all possibilities!

	Difference b/w empty vertex cover and raising exceptiong:
	An empty vertex cover can occur in case of a graph with no edges, where no vertices are
	required to cover all edges, because there are none!

	But, failing to find a valid vertex cover for the edges and thus raising an exception means
	the there's no set of vertices, including the empty set, than can cover all edges of the 
	graph.
