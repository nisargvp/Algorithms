'''seems like a O(n^3) algo but m = O(n^2) in dense connected graphs so a tighter bound of
O(mn) can be established'''

'''
	Extra +1 in for-loop:
	is for taking pathLen to 'n' in the last step, to check for -ve cycles if any value for
	pathLen = n-1 is different from that of pathLen = n, there's a -ve cycle because then in
	this last step we could travel on this -ve cycle, revisiting some node and reduce the 
	value, and thus changing the path that was logged for pathLen = n-1
	Changing of entire path b/w these two steps is crucial but subtle, and it may happens every
	time pathLen changes, not just for n-1 and n. Going from n-1 to n gives only one extra edge
	that can be added to out path, but a cycle must have more than 2 edge, so entire path is
	altered to accomodate a cycel where nodes can be revisited. If this cycle happens to be -ve
	value will change and this cycle will be detected!

'''TODO: check -ve cycles extention, once graph for it is obtained'''
