'''
	Optimal BST (OBST):
	A BST that provides better look ups on average than a balanced BST, provided frequecies
	of various look ups is given. May or may not be balanced.
'''

'''
	Average/Weighted Search Time (WST) of Optimal BST:
	Search time for a given node in an BST refers to the number of nodes encountered in the
	path taken to find the given node, which also includes given node.
	WST of a OBST then refers to the weighted sum of the search times of every node in the tree,
	each search time weighted by a given frequency or weight of that node.
