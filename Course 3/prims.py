'''prims.py: Graph Theory/Greedy Algorithm'''

'''@author: Pranjal Verma'''

'''In the na誰ve implementaion, similar to the na誰ve version of dijkstra, when X (explored) has
at least n/2 vertices in it (event), we're already looking at O(n) vertices and all their edges,
because the graph is at least weakly connected and we're only looking at crossing edges 
in this slightly better implementation, instead of even more na誰vely iter-ing over all edges 
to first find crossing edges. So total run-time is dominated by O(n^2) after this event, and 
this bound can be tightned by O(nm)!'''

'''You can select blocks of code to put inside a type of bracketing and then bracket this block'''
